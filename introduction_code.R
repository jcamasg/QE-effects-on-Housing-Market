# Introduction

# In this document, the data used in Chakraborty et al. (2020) will be cleaned and prepared for analysis. 
# The data was extracted from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) platform, specifically from the SAS Studio portal, 
# and corresponds to the Call Reports of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

# The original source and replication code were taken from Philipp Schnabl's NYU personal website.
# The code was later modified to retrieve raw data from 2005Q4 to 2012Q4.
